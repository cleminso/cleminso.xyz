The purpose of this section is to provide more clarity on some important blockchain terms.   

I express why and what these terms mean. They are not at all absolute definitions, but they do make sense for me, and I hope for you too.

Huge tahnk you to my friend [Nicolas](https://twitter.com/nicolasembleton), for him help and support to provide a quality content.
