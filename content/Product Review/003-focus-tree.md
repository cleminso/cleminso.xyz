With this review, I'll highlight the benefices of using of an application like [Focus Tree](https://www.focustree.app/). Also provide product suggestions and show how the gamification is implicated in the app. While being as neutral as possible.

If I should describe Focus Tree in 3 words: focus; gamification, productivity

## What's Focus Tree?

Focus Tree is a focus app that enables users to spend less time on their phone and to keep control of their attention. 

During the last decade, social media become addictive, our attention become the bread and butter for this app. Without our attention time, these apps cannot survive with the current model. We are at the driving force, for the survival of these applications.

However, these applications are also a good place to show what is your domain expertise and acquire new customers. As consumers, it's a good place to discover new domains/subjects. But you can develop some addictions and loss a lot of time. Imo the goal it's to find an equilibrium with yourself.

### What's the Focus Tree mission?

The mission is simple, is to help users to **stay focus** and achieve their goals. Why? to **build a healthy relationship** with technology and their screens time.

Also, the mission is to provide a universal experience, to answer for different types of persona, students to people around forty, and probably our grandparents

### Why do people seek to stay focused?

- Achieve defined goals at work
- be present at x moment, like during coffee with friend, family, or during a team meeting
- avoiding/restrict distraction

The problem statement: "I want to increase my productivity and maintain focus on my tasks". 

It's the deal with yourself, if you feel like using too much your phone for x reason. Used an app like Focus Tree can help you by giving incentives to use less your phone.

The how, is more complex because humans are good at lying to themselves and by contouring the system designed to help us. That's where an ingenious gamification and incentives are important for a product like Focus Tree.

## Product Overview

To answer at their needs, Focus Tree team provide some functionalities, let's see what's possible to do:

1. **Focus Session** - restrict the usage of your phone
	- Setup focus session ranging from 10 to 60 min
	How can focus session fail?
	- exiting app for more than 5s
	- pressing the "give up" call to action
2. **Time tracker** - visualize how much time you stay focus for x period
	- We currently can check our focus time history. In the future, we'll be able to see the time spent on each of our phone's applications. 
    Moreover, we'll can improve monitor the usage and show our goals progress. Tagging Session will also be available soon. 
3. **Wallet** - secure your Account
	- self-custody → that means user's manage their keys pair, and they have the responsibility for it
	- utilizing biometrics hardware, provided by your device (Secure Enclave on iOS / StrongBox for Android)

Gamified functionalities and proprieties:
1. **Communities Garden** - group of users
	- build a garden by adding a new Item everyday
2. **Tiles** - app Items
	- users can deposit it in their own garden or community garden.
	- several themes and rarity
3. **Water** - Stamina of your Tree
	- charge by waiting a day or make your tree stronger
4. **Streak** - retention concept 
5. **Focus Points** - earn by focusing
	- how long your streak is
	- how long you focus
	- your tree's level
6. **Leagues** - compete with your ecosystem communities

Currently, is more oriented for a personal usage than a collective usage. However, it is possible to make full use of the application for the original purpose: **not/less to use your phone.**

Some features announced on the roadmap, will improve the experience by different gamified mechanisms.
- marketplace to trade Tiles and Tree NFT → improve user's engagement
- group focus session: follow your friends; group messaging → improve retention app
- season and leaderboard for communities garden → active communities to incentive their users

### Gamification - the success key

The gamification is a crucial point in an application like this. It's important to user's feel and stay engaged to accomplish their goal.

It's also a no-brainer, "ok I want to write 1h every day, I setup 1h focus session and avoid all distraction". Likewise, it's looks like a simple task, but that avoids the temptation to just check your phone to see if you have received a new message.

- By **engaging** gamification we can notice:
	- Tree XP level → day by day you reach new level (suggestion link, can be cool to have new Tree design when we stage x Tree level)
	- Item reward everyday if you focus 
- The **leaderboard** and the **season** (in futur), is a good way to create competition between different communities, and motivated their members = Social engagement
- **Progress tracking** is an important part of gamification. Focus Tree provide it by a Time Tracking and can see how far they've come and what they've achieved = motivating and satisfying
- By enlable the shared garden, user's can be a **member of communities** = interaction; collaboration; "social reconnaissance" probably too much in this case but that true in one sense.
- The **retention** is activated by:
	- Focus 1 time per day = 1 streak
	- focus 1 time per day = Tiles (Items) reveal

### Users Flow

Is the steps for user's to achieve their goals:
1. setup focus time
2. launch focus session
3. stop using your phone
After creating your account it is simple to directly start your first focus sessions. Good point for the product usability.

## Product Suggestions

Here I share some suggestions and ideas about the **product**:
1. **Schedule** your focus time during the day
	1. setup when you want to not use your phone, for example: 2pm to 4pm or after 10 pm I don't want to be distracted
	2. 5 min before, confirm you would like to be focus
	3. you still have the control, but you can push yourself by program focus time
2. See my **focus time average** on the circle where we select the focus time
	- represent it with a "red point" and indicate the time
	- story: "here's an indication of your average focus time"
3. Focus **room** for team/student group
	- story: you're in-person meeting with your team, and to restrict the distraction, everybody setup a focus session in your common garden
		- if someone used a phone, the session fails for everybody
4. Open access to anybody to create their own garden and shared garden with default template
	- story: I want to share a garden with my family, I need to invite my family members
	- the garden admin setup a focus session → that sends a notification to each member, when they confirm it the focus session starts
5. Show the **% of time progress** of the session
6. Allow **offline focus** (if is not possible, I'm curious to know why)

Here I share some suggestions and ideas about the **gamification**:
1. Feed the garden animation with:
	- each of the members has a **Bitmoji**, and they walk in the garden
		- when someone opens the phone, their Bitmoji can say a short sentence like "Hi, come back to focus is not the moment to give up!". The message can vary according to the number of times you check your phone
		- when the focus session is finished, show the Bitmoji + animation on the "congratulation screen"
	- animation a new item added in the garden (it's a new day you do your first focus session, and you want to see which Item are newly added in the garden) (take inspiration of Polytopia flow after each turn)
	- **highlight** the garden Item when one is selected
2. Add **garden level** while how many focus time it has
	- probably more useful for communities. They can encourage their members to focus and reach a new level. As incentive, that can unlock XP boost, tokens, special common Item for the garden.
3. NFT metadata of the Tree changes when user's/community garden reaches a new stage level
4. Daily challenges
	- streak = focus > 10 min today
	- focus > 2 time today = earn x $FOCUS tokens for example

**Fun features** suggestions:

1. **Hardcore mode**: when user checks his phone x time → focus session is over
2. **Song animation** during a focus session
3. **More achievements**: focus after 10pm / reach x XP / have x Tree level > 20 / focus on the weekend / have x Items in one garden
Many possibilities to feed this section.
- Allow users to write what they do during this focus time → use that for week recap → improve weekly goals
	- can personalize tags, not only random tags (like if my weekly goal is to deep dive on x subject, I want to follow my progress)

With this suggestion, I'm trying to stay within the context of Focus Tree and rest according to what they're currently building. It can be seen as an "extension".

## Personal Experience

I already adopted Focus Tree in my daily tool. I using it for 10 days now, and It's a no-brainer, when I start a work session I launch the app, hide my phone back to my laptop, and it's done I'm full focus. It's a deal with me, and know my issues to check regularly my phone, so I am tool to help me.

The product can stay like this, I will continue to use it. In my opinion, the feature that would give me a complete experience would be the ability to schedule focus sessions.

Story: "I wake up at 8am, I want to create a habit and don't use my phone before 9am." Well, like my alarm setup, I'd like to be able to schedule my focus sessions automatically.

I hope the application stays as a "free-to-play" app in the future, or no experience limitation. Or if I need to paid something, it's with in-game asset like $FOCUS token, that I would have gained with my focus time.
