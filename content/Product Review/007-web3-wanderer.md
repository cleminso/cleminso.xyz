*In my [first review](https://cleminso.xyz/product-review/006-web3-conferences/), you can learn more about the process of attending a Web3 conference and the types of participants we can find there.*

Here, I will present to you Web3Wanderer, a tool to discover and schedule your conference journey.

## Product Vision

Web3Wanderer is your companion for navigating the vast landscape of web3 conferences.

### Attendee pain points

To shape a good product, we need to consider the current pain points of attendees during Web3 conferences:
1. The cost of going to the wrong events can be very high. Conversely, the opportunity cost of missing out on the right event can be very high
2. Centralized event lists are often incomplete and put up too late to organize yourself efficiently
	- people often import a feed provided by the organization to their own calendar, and it’s just an unreadable pile of information
	- rapidity of information spread
3. It is stressful to maximize your event schedule
	- the difficulty of finding networking events aligned with your interests
	- the challenge of identifying the right events, leading to uncertain satisfaction (ROI).
4. Difficulty getting to a location
	- It can be hard to find the right event location, and sometimes we’re not informed of the address change

We target points to address pain points 2 and 3 by providing relevant data and helping the users make maximized decisions. 

The long-term target is to address pain points 1 and 2, which we will discover during our journey.

### Current problem statement
- There is a lack of information about events, and they are dispatched to different places
	- it is hard for users to catch up and find the right informations
- Lack of relevant data about the event
	- attendees take the risk of going to events they finally don't like or that don't answer their goals
- A lot of no-show-ups happened during the event
	- some events are only on invitation, and no show-up takes place for someone who really wanted to go to this event
	- it's also a problem for organizers who have false data about their event and can spend more money than is necessary

Unlike traditional event planner platforms that stop at aggregating conferences, we go further.

### Our mission

We help conferencegoers find their tribes and maximize their ROI by having a single place to search for all the events happening.

Our mission is to empower attendees with a personalized experience, ensuring they make informed decisions when choosing and exploring the Web3 conference landscape.

## Last words

Web3Wanderer is the first product we want to build on top of our infrastructure.  
I will present it later. We still have a lot of work to do on it, so probably we will release Web3Wanderer in February.

I'm quite excited to rework this project. I worked on it early this year and stopped to improve my personal skills and perspectives.

With more maturity, I'm happy to see my improvements and how I express my thoughts. Still, a lot of work will happen!
