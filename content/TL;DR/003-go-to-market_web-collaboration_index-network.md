## Speculation as go-to-market Strategy DeFi

From Variant: https://variant.fund/articles/speculation-as-go-to-market-strategy-defi/ 

**All builders know Boostraping methods are the sinews of war for crypto product.**
Users are worried about their money and the risk of a new smart contract.
=> team needs to provide a compelling product to reassure future users and give them good incentives.
- Currently, the most successful project achieves rapid PMF by enabling financial speculation
	=> purpose: providing the initial liquidity spark for the protocol properly function

~ New DeFi entrants should **focus on providing UX** that welcomes speculators

- DeFi protocols are not just new fintech apps; they require motivated participants in a brand new financial market → incentive strategies: airdrop; liquidity mining; high leverage => **financial speculation**

The **risk of** this financial speculation is that it generates metrics and creates the appearance of achieving sustained PMF. It's hard to identify a true PMF,  but one way to know if it's not achieved is to observe what's happened when the incentives and bootstrapping mechanisms are stopped  → these metrics still maintained? What about the user's retention? Do they still have the same engagement?

~ Joseph de la Vega’s [Confusion de Confusiones](https://gwern.net/doc/economics/1688-delavega-confusionofconfusions.pdf) in 1688, described the frenzied nature of financial markets: the author described the early stock market as a “gambling hell” with “two classes of speculators.

- Speculators are, in fact, the first constituent group needed for establishing new markets.

## Collaboration at Scale

[Source](https://inc.mirror.xyz/S6BngEcDHbrzY3bb8w8YOaFPlr8tLarGhigRXY12sA8) from [Arthaud](https://twitter.com/arthaud_)

The author is asking himself a question: web3 provides us with a new set of tools to tackle  civilization’s  most urgent problems.

The problems that will define our future as a species are:
- **global** 
- **wicked in nature** → difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements
Both of them require collaboration → need better tools for collaboration at scale.

1. **Online Collaboration** with internet, where you can:
	- learn
	- coordinate
	- work together independently of national borders
			But certain blockers limit our ability to collaborate:
			- bureaucracy: administrative; banking; fundraising
			- lack of financial incentives for participants
			- lack of trust and transparency
			
			
			
2. **Onchain Collaboration** with Web3 enables and highlights new properties:
	- experimenting new way to work together towards a shared objective (revisiting the bureaucracy)
	- better incentive alignment (financial incentives)
		- ownership => makes collaboration more scalable
		- holding tokens → shared objective
	- creation of more public goods (improve the trust and transparency)
		- transparent because that can be audited by anyone → don't require trust from a central entity
		- we don't need to trust anyone; we just need to verify each other behavior

Internet + Web3 = set of tools that should be leveraged to **tackle problems** to the best of our ability

**Web3 collaboration at scale:**

1. increases scalability of projects by creating financial incentives to participate
2. breaks down the barriers to participation by decreasing the bureaucracy without requiring pre-existing trust

### Project: Index Network 

Empowers individuals to build and use custom search engines without compromising data ownership, composability, collaboration, or monetization.

**What** [Index Network](https://index.network/) provide?
- a tool that enables users to translate their expertise and skills into valuable, owned, and monetizable content (= blockchain proprieties).
Current problem: "Web discovery tools have fallen short when it comes to connecting users with meaningful information online"

**How** does Index Network work?

- Powered by Lit protocol, creators and users can:
	- establish on-chain access
	- linked collaboration
	- monetization
	- DAO membership
	- own particular NFT
- Via Ceramic Network, IN offers
	- data interoperability and composability
	- allows discoverability of different data models, such as:
		- attestation; events and products
	- build on top of IPFS, Ceramic offers:
		- guarantees indexes are housed on a decentralized network
		- letting users construct, own, and store their data (independent of centralized third parties).

**What's possible** with Index Network?

- user's can create and design custom search engines:
	- each index focuses only on the content specified by the user.
	- index are searchable and filterable → work as topic based search engines
	- AI provides: predictive search / semantic comprehension => fostering richer and more contextually revealed search results
- creating indexes
- monetizing access to indexes
