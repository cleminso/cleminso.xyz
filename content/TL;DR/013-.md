## Super Knowledges

Source [Knowledge vs Intelligence](https://exa.ai/blog/superknowledge) from [William Bryk](https://x.com/WilliamBryk)

In response to [Ilya Sutskever](https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1803472978753303014), William Bryk argues that superknowledge, rather than superintelligence, poses more technical challenges.
He mentions the world is far shorter on knowledge than intelligence, qualified as a dangerous situation.
