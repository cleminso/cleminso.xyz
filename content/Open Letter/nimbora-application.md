*I am currently searching for a product position. I'd like to know if product and UX-oriented positions are open at Nimbora? So I contacted Sacha, who put me in touch with Edi.*

*Nimbora is a project that interests me for the possibilities and innovations it could bring to the Starknet ecosystem. 
After following the Starknet ecosystem for 2 years (contributing via [Starknet France](https://twitter.com/StarknetFr)), it would be a pleasure to contribute more with [Nimbora](https://www.nimbora.io/)!*

*The goal of this letter is to present myself and demonstrate that I'm a good potential fit and can provide value to the Nimbora team.*

*With this open letter, I hope to show my way to think and distinguish myself via the presentation format.*

I'm Cl√©ment, a junior product aspirant, and, since ~10 months, I have started a journey fully product-oriented.

My past and current experiences:
- A product to aggregate and manage your schedule during a Web3 conference (the product PoC is not live yet)
- My current side project is about a fully private and encrypted protocol to enable users to save and share data (still in the early stages)
- In mid-October, I changed my way of working and started to build in public by creating this website. I spend ~50% of my week on it.  
The idea is to adopt a **proactive attitude** by producing content rather than waiting for someone to hire me.
- I've volunteered to help the Turbo project create a new UX. 
I'm doing it as training to build up a UX design portfolio.

I've learned and accumulated product knowledge by practicing myself; I'm self made.

**About my Skills**
- Motivated by delivering user value, I like to start by building the system flow, establishing stakeholder relations, and highlighting important system issues.
- Craving to map a situation or problem leads to collaborative reflection with the team
	- shape product vision and establish a product strategy (how to execute).
- Identify and engage with stakeholders to ensure the right alignment with the product we currently build (user's interactions).
- A good command of the Figma tool, from wireframe creation to prototyping (UX/UI). I follow and complete the [UX design DeFi course](https://www.design3.io/certified-course-ux-design-defi) by [Jon Crabb](https://twitter.com/JonCrabb).
- Ability to transform tech assumptions and details into comprehensible language for users.


In summary, I'm engaging to **maximize the product value** and deliver value to different stakeholders in **collaboration** with the team. 

I like to provide ideas to innovate and explore new approaches to improve the current state.

**What can you expect from working with me?**
- I'm not afraid to work with autonomy and to lead and start initiatives by myself if they are aligned with the team vision. 
  - Define why and how we do x or y, it's important, and align stakeholders in the same direction.
- I'm a listening person and actively share my progress with stakeholders (team, users). 
- I like to do things well and finish, not rush things to say they're finished and deliver bad value. For me, it is important to reevaluate our capacity as a team and manage our goals accordingly.
- I don't hesitate to enlist the help of other team members with particular expertise in order to unblock a situation. 

I also like joking; send memes during the appropriate moment :)

I hope you can learn more about me, how I work, the values that are important to me, and about my past experience.

I am flexible as to how we can work together, start in part-time, full time with 3 months test period...

My portfolio is this website. By diving inside, you will discover more about how I think and one part of the value I can deliver in '[Product Review](https://cleminso.xyz/product-review/)'.

In '[Definitions](https://cleminso.xyz/definitions/)', you will discover my ability to transform tech language into comprehensible language for users.
