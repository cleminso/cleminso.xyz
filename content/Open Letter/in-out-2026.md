2026 for me, will be:

### In

- focus working on Regarde SDK (handle payment management; contacts; cli)
- release a public v1 of Regarde SDK by May 2026
- double down into AI to build and learn
- take time to know more tools i use
- no phone directly after wake up instead start some music -> stretch -> coffee -> go to my desk
- continue daily evening walk
- increase dailys stretch and weekly exercices
- find simple recipes i can manage to make for lunch and dinner (to avoid ordering online and save money)[learn new skills and habits]
- a movie per week or watch series - i've so much cult movie un-watched

### Out

- doomscrolling and phone distractions
- working after 10-11pm
