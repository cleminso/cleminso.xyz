In fact it was a starter year for me to learn about AI and coding, and I've been focusing on that ever since. The first half was a lot of struggle, the second have been where it started to become fun and with a lot of learnings about Jazz-tools, how can i build a frontend, how to use AI.

## What's finally in and out

2025 I've been:

- AI coding with Aider -> Zed asistant -> Augment -> Opencode (ollama cloud model)
- dropped my interest for web3 and instead focus on Jazz-tools
- haven't learn about animation at all to focus on backend
- up and down about writing, taking personal notes about my daily work but didn't published it (yet).
- making food occasionally during the year and regularly since nov-dec (move to a new place making it more enjoyable)
- daily stretch and pushups since december
- no online revenue this year
- lost my interest for the ecosystem
- deleting a bunch of bookmarks; notes from AnyType to browsers => cleaner context to avoid noise
- gathering blogs via NetNewsWire RSS feed (stop subscribing to newsletter when possible)

### In

- home desk setup with a second monitor and a mouse/keyboard - quite happy with it for now
- cooking
- no phone on the desk while working, only outside the room and have to do 10-15 pushes up when i'm using it
- daily evening walk

### Out

- Uninstall Clash of Clans around 9 may 2025. A huge stepˆˆ I take back ~1h of my day and focus
- Uninstall Instagram app on mobile. I still use it quickly via web without an optimized experience to keep in touch with account I like
- i've delete 80% of my twitter follow and see a huge difference on the content quality. Mostly deleted crypto related followers. Same on instagram
- being more careful about who i follow on social media to avoid noise
- crypto learning, simply passive portfolio management
- no phone directly after wake up
