Nick was busy with their main work; working on it alone was not motivating because I depended too much on Nick to develop and code our project. I tried new competencies in Q2 on-chain analysis token-engineering But it was not really successful; my mindset approach was not good, and starting from 0 was very hard. I decided to focus again on product development and UX Q3, we think about a general product called 0ptima, a protocol where data is encrypted by default and anyone can create their own applications I think of and shape a first application to build on top of it Nick started to think about the infrastructure Q4 was the most productive and prosperous period Launched my website, started to write, and started to express my thoughts Rework on Web3Wanderer, shape the vision with more maturity than Q1 Nick really started the code development for 0ptima (I was happyˆˆ) My site as blue zone I started my website in mid-October; it was something I always liked to do. But that was finally presented to me as flash evidence It was something to redynamize myself after spending “3 empty months” and being back in my second home I’m happy about what I produce. I have several concepts that make sense to me. That aligned with my goal to create my mental model and reflection about Web3, finally where I’m born. What I learn - about work UI/UX English is now my second language; soon first :) Project management; Agile methodology; system and UX mapping Don’t trust when someone says, ‘I have a job for you; apply and it will be ok’ Break my mental gates about coding and start to touch on some concepts What I learning - about me Manage your expectations with people (while they promise you a job but are not the final decision-makers in the company) A simple question can change your mind: why, how, or what? Really made the effort to think and used my brain Being less lazy to do simple action every day helps and is satisfied Ignorance hurts a lot. Accepting that you don’t have answers from people can happen (I can quickly drop it and continue my way, at least, which is not bad) Radical choice, help me again this year Health: don’t wait; work can wait tomorrow Don’t wait for others Human behavior and system behavior Saying “I love you” will not kill me Music has an important place in my day, and I should develop my knowledge about what I listen to I’m still limited on: I don’t know how to code my own project; I depend too much on others There are still some English improvements to be made express my thoughts and show up with my value proposition What’s my focus for 2024 target the core value for each subjects I studying launch Web3Wanderer find a way to bootstrapping or financed the project as public good find front-end dev to launch first version of 0ptima + 1-2 project build on top of shape the product vision + mental model explore possibilities and find a first target audience mapping of the network effect generate Apps idea Send more applications to find a job and get interviews Continue in my way, continue to write, express my thoughs, continue to learn and develop my network. I don’t know peoples in same vibes than me. Continue to consume writing but produce my own too. Consume more videos content too.\nPersonal I’m self-made and start from 0. I’m “late” about several tech concepts, and it’s taken me a while to catch up on all of the concepts and important steps of each concept. So, I want to know the core values that drive each concept. I like it because I often discover a lot of founders whose projects wrongly use words, which can be confusing for users and improve the misunderstanding between projects. This also gives me a solid basis for communicating with senior citizens and compensates for my lack of experience.\nThis end of the year is quite painful to spend it alone. For 2024, I really need to create better equilibrium between work and human contact. I spend most of my days talking to myself, hanging out two times per week to co-work with Nick. Some hanging-out dates I tried gym for 3 months before being back in France; it was good, but I don’t prioritize these activities during the summer, so that cut off human contact.\nI am seeking my first experience with a company or project. To achieve it, it will probably lighten me on some points like: concretize my work; skills are valuable and someone trusts me; have a stable financial income; that is not the case for 2023, where I make money on Q1 and no more.\n","wordCount":"815","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-01-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-01-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"cleminso"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://cleminso.xyz/open-letter/2023-review/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TL;DR","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cleminso.xyz/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/ accesskey=h title="TL;DR (Alt + H)">TL;DR</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/product-review/ title="Product Review"><span>Product Review</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/tldr/ title=TL;DR><span>TL;DR</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/definitions/ title=Definitions><span>Definitions</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/open-letter/ title="Open Letter"><span>Open Letter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/now/ title=Now><span>Now</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">2023 Review</h1><div class=post-description>Personal and non-exhaustive introspection of 2023.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-01-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 6, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;815 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;cleminso</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><ul><li><a href=#project--works aria-label="Project & Works">Project & Works</a></li><li><a href=#my-site-as-blue-zone aria-label="My site as blue zone">My site as blue zone</a></li><li><a href=#what-i-learn---about-work aria-label="What I learn - about work">What I learn - about work</a></li><li><a href=#what-i-learning---about-me aria-label="What I learning - about me">What I learning - about me</a></li><li><a href=#im-still-limited-on aria-label="I&rsquo;m still limited on:">I&rsquo;m still limited on:</a></li></ul><li><a href=#whats-my-focus-for-2024 aria-label="What&rsquo;s my focus for 2024">What&rsquo;s my focus for 2024</a><ul><li><a href=#personal aria-label=Personal>Personal</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h3 id=project--works>Project & Works<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#project--works>#</a></h3><ul><li>Q1, started and paused the Web3Wanderer project in February.
