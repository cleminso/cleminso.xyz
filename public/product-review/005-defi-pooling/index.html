We can use a centralized operator for unlimited scalability, but that requires trusting the integrity of this operator. For newcomers, Centralized Exchange (CEX) are often the first way to interact with crypto. Their values reside in the way they abstract the complexity of technology (wallet key management, for example). But this is like using a bank account.\nThe user doesn’t control and own their funds; funds can be removed or frozen; and you need to prove your identity (so you lose your anonymity). The consequences are that all of your actions are traceable and associated with your identity.\nTo contrast, in DeFi you’re the owner of your wallet keys. That means you have the responsibility of your funds, you can manage; deploy it where and when you want. The risk is to lose your seed phrase, a compromise of your private keys, or interact with a scam contracts. But enter in DeFi, open new perspectives.\nJump into DeFi DeFi exists to be a decentralized alternative to traditional financial actors without the need to trust an intermediary. Built on top of blockchain and smart contract technology. DeFi has the goal of making the financial system more transparent and accessible.\nIn other words, DeFi refers to financial Decentralized Applications (DApps) using Blockchain technology that inherit these properties and values.\nWhat are the DeFi benefits? The decentralization allows censorship resistance; anyone can participate. Network effects by integrating or supporting DApps, together Inheritance of Blockchain infrastructure benefits; fast and “low cost” transactions; immutability of smart contracts; noncustodial ownership It’s nice, but only in theory. The ecosystem is still growing and needs to search for its marks. It’s through testing that we can innovate and learn from empirical experiences like life.\nDeFi has some requirements Scalability to support several users at the same time and for a long period Fast and low transaction costs to provide a better UX than traditional finance the blockchain state is often updated (we talk in seconds). we refer to the state by block or batch for Layer 2. These requirements are exactly the current pain points for actual and future users if we stay on Ethereum (L1). L1 has all the security benefits to support a financial system. But L1 doesn’t have a good UX, so let’s introduce to Starknet L2 and DeFi Pooling System.\nStarknet and DeFi Pooling Layer 2’s are the closest solutions to scaling Ethereum. While being built on top of Ethereum, they inherit the Ethereum security.\nThis is a fast explanation of Starknet and how transactions work:\noff-chain Prover: process a batch of transactions and prepare a system state update It also generates a STARK proof. The Prover sends it to the on-chain Verifier on-chain Verifier: receive the system state update and the STARK proof the proof is verified to be valid, and only when the state update be committed on-chain Starknet scales by moving the transactions execution off-chain and attesting the execution integrity on-chain with a STARKs proof.\nSimple to said, but to truly understand that require to understand STARK proof, and it’s long, haha. Resources are available on the StarkWare site.\nAll of that to store the data on L1. That allows developers to consume this data, but why would they want to do that?\nImagine interacting with L1 DeFi protocols from L2, let’s introduce DeFi Pooling.\nHow does DeFi Pooling work? Through Starknet L1-L2 messaging, contracts on L2 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L1. With L1-L2 messaging, it’s possible to:\nTalk with L1 by sending a message and by calling send_message_to_L1 the message parameters contain the recipient contract on L1 + relevant data Starknet node operators (Prover and Verifier) will generate a STARK proof for these messages and verify the validity When the transaction is proved and the L1 state is updated, the message is stored on L1 in the Starknet Core Contract The L1 recipient address can now Consume the message in the Starknet Core Contract Well, it’s based on the same principle to understand theL1-L2 liquidity.\nHow Liquidity moves on between L1-L2 On StarkGate, each token is associated with an L1 and L2 bridge contract, and they communicate through the L1-L2 messaging mechanism.\nThe most important details to know about, how StarkGate works are the mint \u0026 burn mechanisms:\nWhen users initiate a deposit via StarkGate; a function is called to mint the corresponding token for the users. When users initiate a withdraw via StarkGate; a function is called to burn the corresponding token from the balance of L2 users. The power of this system is that liquidity always resides on L1! and all transactions are attached to a STARK proof with which we can verify their validity. By the way, that allows other features, like Escape Hatch, to allow users to directly withdraw from L1 (in case the system has problems).\nAfter all, it’s designed to meet user needs and solve existing pain points. In the next review, let’s study Nimbora, a project, rather than push DeFi Pooling, into production.\nProduct Suggestions Open liquidity management We can imagine a world powered by messaging + STARK proof to attest to the integrity of any messages/transactions.\nNow L2 is your dashboard. Manage and communicate with L1 and others Rollup’s (always using L1 messaging).\nThe idea is to stop liquidity fragmentation. We can imagine interacting with Arbitrum from Starknet using Ethereum.\nStarknet ⟷ Ethereum and Ethereum ⟷ Arbitrum\nFurthermore, we can imagine doing that with private chains such as Aztec. Initiating your on/off ramp from Starknet but using this liquidity on a private network, or the other way around.\nOf course, that requires a strong messaging mechanism from these L2s.\nImagine customizing your L3 for specific functionalities and specialized applications.\nMoreover, create, communicate, and interact with L3. You can create your own private L3 Madara or app chain Karnot based on your needs.\nCreate a data storage place. Request data from another chain, relay it,, share it where you want.\nStop Bridge, say hello to messaging! Imagine no more bridges, only messaging between chains. Stop the need to deploy token contracts on a new chain and increase liquidity fragmentation. With messaging, deploy a Verifier contract and proof the integrity from L2, with a STARK proof.\nLike this, assets live on one chain. To move on another chain, the messaging bridge uses mint \u0026 burn mechanisms and a call function to send the token to the corresponding users.\nWe know that bridges are vulnerable to security breaches and are the target of numerous hacks.\nGas Delegation The idea is to enable users to create a gas tank on L2 and deploy it where and when they want.\nAt the protocol level, there is an arbitrage on the gas. For users, there is a de-fractrionalization of gas and an UX improvement.\nImagine executing a transaction during a high Gwei peak.\nA good place to improve this idea\n","wordCount":"1148","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-11-14T10:02:06+02:00","dateModified":"2023-11-14T10:02:06+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"cleminso"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://cleminso.xyz/product-review/005-defi-pooling/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TL;DR","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cleminso.xyz/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/ accesskey=h title="TL;DR (Alt + H)">TL;DR</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/product-review/ title="Product Review"><span>Product Review</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/tldr/ title=TL;DR><span>TL;DR</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/definitions/ title=Definitions><span>Definitions</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/open-letter/ title="Open Letter"><span>Open Letter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/now/ title=Now><span>Now</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">005 - DeFi Pooling Review</h1><div class=post-description>Interact with L1 from L2!</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-11-14 10:02:06 +0200 +0200'>November 14, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1148 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;cleminso</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#jump-into-defi>Jump into DeFi</a><ul><li><a href=#what-are-the-defi-benefits>What are the DeFi benefits?</a></li><li><a href=#defi-has-some-requirements>DeFi has some requirements</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#starknet-and-defi-pooling>Starknet and DeFi Pooling</a><ul><li><a href=#how-does-defi-pooling-work>How does DeFi Pooling work?</a></li><li><a href=#how-liquidity-moves-on-between-l1-l2>How Liquidity moves on between L1-L2</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#product-suggestions>Product Suggestions</a><ul><li><a href=#open-liquidity-management>Open liquidity management</a></li><li><a href=#stop-bridge-say-hello-to-messaging>Stop Bridge, say hello to messaging!</a></li><li><a href=#gas-delegation>Gas Delegation</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Blockchain scalability is limited.
