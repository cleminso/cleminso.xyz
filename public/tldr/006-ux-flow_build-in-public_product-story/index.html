Timing Team/Execution Great people and execution can triumph over another company working on the same idea but with a poorer team and execution. Idea: ‘Truth’ Outlier Business Model Funding Find the complete answer in his TED talk by Bill Gross\nCase study: Wise stands out compared to other companies:\nlaunched their first public roadmap and used this opportunity to get feedback from users on the roadmap action: build a roadmap and publish it goal: received feedback from users execution: listen to users; categorize and execute feedback publish their product team structure and regional focus areas organize Mission Days this event invites users to collect ideas and shape their future roadmap Why are companies built in public?\nto earn the trust of their users give a transparency allows teams to receive direct feedback from their users Build an idea funnel users give feedback on what they like about the roadmap and what they don’t company pov: that provide an idea flow and Lessons for Product Managers\nCustomer trust is a big factor that can determine the success or failure of your company. Building in public is a great tool to get more ideas from your customers. Your ability to execute is more important than your ideas or business model.

The goal was to find another name that wasn’t that derivative.

The accident in which Gabor.C sent out an email to users announcing that we’ll take back their handle. That caused users to return across every cohort we ever onboarded 1 day for the rebrand announcement DAU chart over time, marked up with key events Others metrics:\nWeek-to-week retention chart shows what $% of users that joined in a given week came back to the product N weeks later Cumulatively registered accounts on the platform ~20k registered users 33k people on the waitlist Why did the team fail?\n“The topline reason for the shutdown was that we couldn’t figure out how to grow.”\nThere were several alternatives, and they couldn’t clearly articulate a differentiator between trust and safety.

Listen to users, show them you care, and act in consequence. early adopters want to contribute, help, and have a connection with the founders. Don’t neglect this point not rely on press as a growth engine Prioritize trust and safety moderation becomes more tractable with AI classifiers misinformation is still hard to identify but can be easily flagged by users =\u003e Bluesky example: unseemly content got posted early on the platform, and after more proactive moderation, the idea of Bluesky as an unsafe place is still present. Gabor questioned\nStart earlier, after leaving Google in July 2022 it was one of the first startup ideas he had but he hesitated since I didn’t think the takeover would go this badly Started with a Fully Algotithmic Timeline good feedback, but some users had expressed a very strong preference for a reverse-chron feed that gave them the feeling of full visibility. “In retrospect, we should have never launched anything else.” Based on the post-TikTok world, doing an algorithmic feed would be a no-brainer A lack of clarity about what kind of content we want to see in T2 firstly, focus on a single type of users Summaries with someone who wants to lunch on a Twitter alternative or something similar attract interesting content to help the daily retention give tools to help this retention had several growth strategies and did not bet on only one strategy be clear about what kind of content you want to see on your platform. That resume comes from your product vision, why you build your product, and for whom it is intended. After that, plan how you will execute it.
