aims to be public and open\nIt wants to recruit people to its cause and influence them through membership numbers Its goals are legible and visible to all, and they need to be made agreeable to those involved Conspiracy - aims to be private and largely closed\nIts existence and goals may never be known outside of the group Crypto, as the brainchild of the Cypherpunks, is a technology oriented towards activism, with an emphasis on openness, transparency, democratic decision-making, and equality of power as values.\nBut to succeed, move towards the Conspiracy end of the axis and do things that don’t scale is the ‘best way’\n→ Tools for Conspiracy\nIdeological beliefs was necessary to start and legitimate crypto across the world. Now these are restraining us.\nCrypto recognizes the trust problem on the Internet, and most of our institutions cannot sustain it.\nThe blockchain approach is:\nbuild a new trustless system ‘if you can observe everything, including all the immutable rules that you will subject yourself to as well as what everyone else is doing, you can independently verify you won’t get screwed’ Arnaud thinks ’the idea that trustlessness implies ineffectiveness’ and we should:\nbuild tools and technology that help establish trust. towards building tools for conspiracy give small groups the ability to find each other, acquire resources, coordinate, and act without needing the approval of others or making their existence known Give people a neutral tool to enable them to pursue their own goals without having to ask for anyone’s permission or involving anyone they don’t want to involve.\nI really like the last sentence: give tools to enable everyone to pursue their own goals. We can see it with the Farcaster Protocol, which enables builders to develop their app and create on top of it, taking advantage of the social network effect.\nThat is what we aim to develop with 0ptima: enable people to create their own economy based on privacy rights.\nFrames Source How to think about Frames by Christian Montoya.\nWhat is a Frame? Is embedded media the media are not interactive or embedded webpages; they result from buttons but the frame itself is interactive Is like open graph tags but with buttons underneath that enable users to interact with the embedded media. Frame acts more like a traditional web app that don’t use wallets or connector services How is work? the user clicks on the buttons the post request is sent with a signed payload to the IRL provided in the Frame that URL responds with another Frame the signed payload includes which button was pressed and a cryptographic hash that can be used to reliably identify the user who submitted it important because it means you can filter out bots from interacting with the Frame, or hitting the endpoint With Frames, however, you can decode the signed payload and find the ID of the user that submitted the request for any action that you want to limit to real users.\nSponsored actions Transactions are possible, sponsored, and facilitated by the server\ndev created an NFT contract and put up funds ahead of time to cover the cost of each mint users click mint btn, the server finds the connected address for that user and mint the NFT with the dev wallet to the user’s address there is a tx but the user isn’t doing the tx, and doesn’t pay for it I’m impatient to see more Frame experiences, whether basic or funny. That has the potential to simplify actions and improve UX at several levels, powered by an open protocol, Farcaster.\n","wordCount":"848","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-02-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cleminso"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://cleminso.xyz/tldr/011-new-way-to-approach-crypto-product_frames/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TL;DR","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cleminso.xyz/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/ accesskey=h title="TL;DR (Alt + H)">TL;DR</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/product-review/ title="Product Review"><span>Product Review</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/tldr/ title=TL;DR><span>TL;DR</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/definitions/ title=Definitions><span>Definitions</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/open-letter/ title="Open Letter"><span>Open Letter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/now/ title=Now><span>Now</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://cleminso.xyz/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">TL;DR #011 - New way to approach crypto product, Frames</h1><div class=post-description>In this TL;DR, discover a new way way to build crypto product and what is Farcaster Frame.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 7, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;848 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Cleminso</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#on-crypto aria-label="On Crypto">On Crypto</a></li><li><a href=#frames aria-label=Frames>Frames</a><ul><li><a href=#what-is-a-frame aria-label="What is a Frame?">What is a Frame?</a></li><li><a href=#how-is-work aria-label="How is work?">How is work?</a></li><li><a href=#sponsored-actions aria-label="Sponsored actions">Sponsored actions</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=on-crypto>On Crypto<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#on-crypto>#</a></h2><p>Source <a href=https://gestalt.cafe/on-crypto/>On Crypto</a> essay by <a href=https://twitter.com/_arnauds_>Arnaud Schenk</a></p><p>In this essay, Arnaud explains how we approached crypto in the past and how we can progress now towards tools for conspiracy ideology.</p><p>Crypto space can be summarized into two unaligned baheviors:</p><ul><li>early believers, mostly drive by cypherpunk ideology</li><li>mindless and speculative, mostly drive by the gain and care about the good health of the crypto space</li></ul><p>→ Rethink the way to build?</p><ol><li><p>Being more solution-oriented than problem-oriented
