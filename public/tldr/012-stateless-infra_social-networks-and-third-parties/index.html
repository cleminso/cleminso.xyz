Servers with redundancy - Add redundancy and the ability for anyone to spin up a server, and you get some decentralization but also retain the max efficiency of traditional servers. These are maximally decentralized constructions, running peer-to-peer, but there’s no consensus (or loose consensus) run with an honest-minority assumption, and even a network with 10-100 nodes is perfectly decentralized can be certain types there’s one node, thx validity proofs don’t need more (storage proof) Stateless infra can enable a lot of features incorrectly attributed to blockchains, but without the burden of consensus can have a state but not a real-time strict consensus state with strict state transitions associated with blockchains Why do we need stateless infra Current statement:\nblockchains are extremely inefficient, requiring tens of thousands of time overheads over a server for the same compute validity proof and DAS aim to be a solution for more efficiency Solution:\nzk tech can scale up to a million chains with universal synchronous composability and shared-security = million time improvement over monolithic chains, but it’s not enough take a hybrid approach, while retaining decentralization run on p2p with client running on each person’s computer stuff that needs to be coordinated on servers → moved to a p2p stateless infrastructure struff that needs verifiability but no consensus→ run on ZK coprocessors stuff that needs strict global consensus → run on zkR/validiums = parallelizing across multiple cores and multiple machines is much easier with stateless infra, which can lead to exponentially higher scale.\nDecentralisation of Stateless infra vs Blockchain Blockchain:\nneed to achieve strict global consensus (difficult process) + expensive Sybil resistance mechanism with honest-majority assumptions block production mechanism is at best a plutocracy (proof-of-stake) and at worst a corporatocracy (proof-of-work) → mitigate by node running but still operate with honest-majority assumptions + need thousands of nodes to achieve any level of resilience for the consensus-forming process Stateless Infra:\nmost of them will be fine with honest-minority assumptions → as long as there’s one node, it’s all fine they can be much more decentralizeds with much fewer nodes + fewer points of failure and centralization = In short, if strict global consensus is not required, peer-to-peer stateless infra is both more efficient and more decentralized than blockchains.
