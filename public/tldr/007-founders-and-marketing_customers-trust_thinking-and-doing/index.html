They call the marketing team and ask them to tell a story about the product and get it out to the world. The marketing team will try to create a story around ‘what is our product’ and not ‘why we have built this product’. express “you’re bringing or the pain you’re killing for your end customer?” =\u003e The product and the marketing both need to be created at the beginning together.

Expressing the why should be a core part of the product team, and for that, a product person would be better able to communicate about the product than the marketing team. The marketing team sells wind, ok, but why? The tech team provides enough value to help the marketing team build the right story. Maybe not, maybe yes, but the final result is that marketing often doesn’t communicate the right product value.\nIn fact, marketing professionals have a direct impact on users via social media. It is important to propagate good values, and the core message at the first interaction is important. A recent personal experience was the first time I interacted with a marketing person.\nI almost went freelance with a founder who was 100% marketing, and after a few meetings, I wanted to run away because of his way of thinking and the wrong incentives for doing this.\nWith transparency, I was staying a bit because I needed money, so I tried to abstract this part and just build a realistic scope that provides value in x delay.\nUnfortunately or not, we don’t work together, and the project doesn’t start after 3 months.\nWhy customers trust is important?
