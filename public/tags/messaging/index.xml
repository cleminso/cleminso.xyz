You need to provide your intent and the necessary data, such as &amp;lsquo;amount requested&amp;rsquo;
=&amp;gt; message You need to send your intent in understandable words and provide the sender and receiver of the order =&amp;gt; transaction the institution who execute, it needs to understand and ensure the transaction is legitimate =&amp;gt; signature Let&amp;rsquo;s compare it with what happens when users initiate an interaction with a blockchain.</description>
